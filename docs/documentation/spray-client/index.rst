spray-client
============

*spray-client* provides high-level HTTP client functionality by adding another logic layer on top of the relatively
basic *spray-can* :ref:`HTTP Client APIs`. It doesn't yet provide all the features that we'd like to include
eventually, but it should already be of some utility for many applications.

Currently it allows you to wrap any one of the three *spray-can* client-side API levels with a pipelining logic,
which provides for:

- Convenient request building
- Authentication
- Compression / Decompression
- Marshalling / Unmarshalling from and to your custom types

Currently, HTTP streaming (i.e. chunked transfer encoding) is not yet supported on the *spray-client* level (even though
the underlying *spray-can* :ref:`HTTP Client APIs` do support it (the host- and request-level APIs only for responses)),
i.e. you cannot send chunked requests and the ``response-chunk-aggregation-limit`` config setting for the underlying
transport must be non-zero).


Dependencies
------------

Apart from the Scala library (see :ref:`Current Versions` chapter) *spray-client* depends on

- :ref:`spray-can`
- :ref:`spray-http`
- :ref:`spray-httpx`
- :ref:`spray-util`
- akka-actor 2.2.x (with 'provided' scope, i.e. you need to pull it in yourself)


Installation
------------

The :ref:`maven-repo` chapter contains all the info about how to pull *spray-client* into your classpath.


Usage
-----

The simplest of all use cases is this:

.. includecode:: code/docs/ClientPipeliningExamplesSpec.scala
   :snippet: simple-request-level-pipeline

The central element of a *spray-client* pipeline is ``sendReceive``, which produces a function
``HttpRequest => Future[HttpResponse]`` (this function type is also aliased to ``SendReceive``). When called without
parameters ``sendReceive`` will automatically use the ``IO(Http)`` extension of an implicitly available ``ActorSystem``
to access the *spray-can* :ref:`RequestLevelApi`. All requests must therefore either carry an absolute URI or an
explicit ``Host`` header.

In order to wrap pipelining around *spray-can*'s :ref:`HostLevelApi` you need to tell ``sendReceive`` which
host connector to use:

.. includecode:: code/docs/ClientPipeliningExamplesSpec.scala
   :snippet: simple-host-level-pipeline

You can then fire requests with relative URIs and without ``Host`` header into the pipeline.

A pipeline of type ``HttpRequest => Future[HttpResponse]`` is nice start but leaves the creation of requests and
interpretation of responses completely to you. Many times you actually want to send and/or receive custom objects that
need to be serialized to HTTP requests or deserialized from HTTP responses.
Check out this snippet for an example of what *spray-client* pipelining can do for you in that regard:

.. includecode:: code/docs/ClientPipeliningExamplesSpec.scala
   :snippet: large-request-level-pipeline

This defines a more complex pipeline that takes an ``HttpRequest``, adds headers and compresses its entity before
dispatching it to the target server (the ``sendReceive`` element of the pipeline). The response coming back is then
decompressed and its entity unmarshalled.

When you ``import spray.client.pipelining._`` you not only get easy access to ``sendReceive`` but also all elements of
the :ref:`spray-httpx` :ref:`RequestBuilding` and :ref:`ResponseTransformation` traits. Therefore you can easily create
requests via something like ``Post("/orders", Order(42))``, which is not only shorter but also provides for
automatic marshalling of custom types.


Example
-------

The `/examples/spray-client/`__ directory of the *spray* repository contains an example project for *spray-client*.

__ https://github.com/spray/spray/tree/release/1.2/examples/spray-client

simple-spray-client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This example shows off how to use *spray-client* by querying Google's Elevation API to retrieve the elevation of
Mt. Everest.

Follow these steps to run it on your machine:

1. Clone the *spray* repository::

    git clone git://github.com/spray/spray.git

2. Change into the base directory::

    cd spray

3. Run SBT::

    sbt "project simple-spray-client" run

   (If this doesn't work for you your SBT runner cannot deal with grouped arguments. In this case you'll have to
   run the commands ``project simple-spray-client`` and ``run`` sequentially "inside" of SBT.)
