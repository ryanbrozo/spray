json4s Support
==============

In analogy to the :ref:`spray-json-support` *spray-httpx* also provides the Json4sSupport_ and Json4sJacksonSupport_
traits, which automatically provide implicit ``Marshaller`` and ``Unmarshaller`` instances for *all* types if an
implicit ``org.json4s.Formats`` instance is in scope.

When mixing in either one of the two traits you have to implement the abstract member::

    implicit def json4sFormats: Formats

with your custom logic. See the `json4s documentation`_ for more information on how to do this.

.. note:: Since *spray-httpx* only comes with an optional dependency on `json4s-native`_ and `json4s-jackson`_ you still
   have to add either one of them to your project yourself. Check the json4s_ documentation for information on how to do
   this.
